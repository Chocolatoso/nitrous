**Natural Medicine is a social media for enthusiasts of natural health - from herbalism and essential oils, to food as medicine, meditation and spirituality, as well as the relationship of human beings to the natural world through wild-crafting, permaculture and other 'healthy' earth centred practices.**

Many healing modalities are supported from ayurveda to TCM, qi gong and yoga, as well as homesteading community members who might invest in organic principles or grow plants such as herbs and cannabis as medicine and food. Please read some of the posts below, which provide more information about what kind of topics are supported. They are written by our bloggers, for our bloggers.

Our platform enables users to reward and earn LOTUS by publishing or interacting with others on the platform. This token or coin can be exchanged for STEEM, the token for the STEEM blockchain, and into mainstream currencies such as USD. You can read more about how to do that [here](). **Whilst rewards are a bonus, many of our users appreciate the interaction they have with others who share similiar interests.**

Natural Medicine offers free accounts with [delegated LOTUS]() to new users. Simply email us at at welcome@naturalmedicine.io with a short explanation of why you'd like to join our platform, and a potential username or two. Please allow 24 hours for account processing - we're very much human! You will then recieve a PDF with your passkeys, which you ***must keep secure as they allow you to access any earned funds, post and perform any other interactions on the blockchain.***

Once you have signed in, you will then be able to use the same keys to sign in to any of the Steem front ends, such as [Steempeak](), which we recommend for non natural medicine related content, saving drafts and more. We call these various ways to interact with the Steem blockchain 'front ends' and 'dapps' or decentralised apps. There's something on the Steem blockchain for everyone!

**Below you'll find some more information about the various intricacies of Natural Medicine, it's reward system, and the it's link to the STEEM platform. For more information, please feel free to join our Discord by clicking [here](). There is always a friendly person to help you out!**

- Look out for our whale account @uplotus, which rewards excellent content and reshares (commonly called 'resteeming' your post to users) 
- Look out for upvotes from our community and our dolphin account, @lotusup. 
- Have a chance to be curated in ['best of' posts](https://www.naturalmedicine.io/naturalmedicine/@naturalmedicine/a-collection-of-best-natural-health-posts-curation-71) which are collated weekly by our lotus curators for further exposure.

![](https://i.imgur.com/8NdWdo9.png)

We also share the best of the best on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Lotus_Medicine) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Natural-Medicine-On-Steem-1003470073174904/) accounts, giving your blogs even more exposure.

### <span id="Payments">Payments</span>

Payouts are made 7 days after the post/comment is created. You can claim your rewards in your wallet after 7 days. The projected payments may fluctuate (up and down) until the final payment amount is reached. Payments for posts are split between the author (at least 50%) and the curators (up to 50%). The author reward is paid 50% in Lotus Power and 50% in LOTUS by default. **This mirrors Steemit's payment system.** Authors also have the option to decline payout, or be paid in 100% LOTUS! You can also set beneficiaries on your posts, meaning that part of your rewards will go to other users you might like to support.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>

### <span id="Upvotes_and_Downvotes">Upvotes and Downvotes</span>

Upvotes are Natural Medicine's way of saying you like someone's post or comment. To upvote, click on the *Upvote* icon at the bottom of the post/comment. This will reward the post with LOTUS. **If you also have Steem invested, it will upvote in Steem too. Notice that comments and upvotes on Natural Medicine will also appear on the other front ends.** Don't worry if you get a downvote - they are rare, and usually counted by upvotes. 

Our accounts will warn you if they're going to downvote you, and we only downvote if you've plagiarised or wrote a really terrible post just for the rewards! Be mindful about the quality we expect and read more about our posting guidelines [here](https://www.naturalmedicine.io/naturalmedicine/@naturalmedicine/standards-for-content-and-a-little-note-about-rewards-and-downvotes). We're happy to negotiate with you should you recieve a downvote you think you don't deserve - simply pop into our Discord and ask there.

### <span id="What_Is_Curation?">What is Curation?</span>

Up to 50% of the reward for each post goes to the people who upvoted on it. These people are called Curators. The more LOTUS Power you have in your account, the more your votes will be worth, and the more potential curation rewards you can earn! As you engage with the curation process, you’ll learn tricks to earn more. **Upvoting and downvoting are part of the curation process.**

### <span id="Steem,_Steempower,_ SteemDollars_and_Lotus_-What_do_They_ Mean?">Steem, Steempower, Steemdollars and LOTUS - What Do They Mean?</span>

Steem is the primary token of the Steem Blockchain and often a reward on posts. Lotus is our token, and exchangeable for STEEM. 

When you publish and engage on NaturalMedicine.io, you’ll also be earning Steem rewards. If someone on another Steem frontend like SteemLeo  or Steempeak upvotes you, you will earn the token they have staked (or invested. If you’re not sure how to ‘stake’ the tokens you have earnt, read this post).

You will be able to see your Steem rewards for each post if you log on to Steempeak (remember, all Steem interfaces uses the same passkeys!).

**Steempower** or **LotusPower** is also a reward on posts. Exchanging Steem for Steem Power is called "Powering Up" or "Staking". More 'steem' or 'lotus' power is good! You will then: 

- Have greater voting power (STU)
- Receive more curation rewards when voting
- Be able to do more actions (transactions) on the blockchain having more 'Resource Credits'. 

If someone [delegates]() to you (either Steem or Lotus) you'll also have a little bit more 'power' whilst that delegation is activated. It's like being lent more cash to play with - and it can be taken back any time. 

**Steem Dollars** is another Steem token which is often rewarded on posts. You can send these to your bank account via a cryptocurrency wallet. Read more about that [here](). *Link Coming*

>**In your LOTUS wallet on NaturalMedicine.io, you can claim other tokens too (native to other Steem front ends like SteemLeo or Palnet), in one single claim. At this point, you might like to exchange LOTUS for STEEM in [Steem Engine](https://steem-engine.com/). Remember what we said about using the same keys for everything on the Steem blockchain? The same applies here. In Steem Engine, you can find out which tokens you hold, which you have invested or ‘staked’ (or ‘powered up’). You can also claim your earnt tokens in [SteemEngine](https://steem-engine.com/), as well as sell them and buy other tokens, or buy STEEM. You can then exchange your STEEM and SBD for bitcoin on a third-party exchange such as BlockTrades or Bittrex, or power it up so that you earn more STEEM!**
