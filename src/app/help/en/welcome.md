Welcome to LASSECASH
--

We created this place to be a more personal space for smaller content creators and bloggers.

Here you have the option to be part of something from the start and get a decent stake does not cost much here in the beginning stages.

LASSECASH is like STEEM, you can blog from either www.lassecash.com, www.steemit.com or any other condesor site, as long as you use the ‘lassecash’ tag in your post’s tags box, then the post will appear at the STEEM blokchain and on the LASSECASH condenser site.

Purpose of LASSECASH
--

Rewarding truth content and social interaction. The original idea was to create a space for anarcho capitalists and flat earthers to monetize their content, but the first half year of LASSECASH’s life has shown that I attract all kinds of normal people that just want to have fun and earn money at the same time, so for this reason, I would say LASSECASH reward social interaction more then truth content.

Distribution
--

I operate with the K.I.S.S. model (Keep It Simple Stupid). So the distribution is quite simple. Initially 20 million is the first 10 years of reward distributed from @lassecash via the scotbot. (Scotbot is the creation of the STEEM ENGINE which distribute LASSECASH for each post. 11 million was for me (@lasseehlers) and is allocated for my profits and promotion, the decisions of use of these tokens is 100% mine. As I write this then there is ~9.4 million in @lasseehlers account, so already ~1.6 million has been used for promotions and a little sales of the LASSECASH token.

20 million is for rewards after 10 years period. The reason for this, is that blockchain tech evolve so fast, so it is good to have these extra tokens set aside for after the first 10 years and then when the time come decide how these should be distributed.

Also if STEEM SMTs or any other project show a better technology then current STEEM ENGINE tribes, then LASSECASH can be swapped to such a new technology, but for now I am very happy with the STEEM ENGINE tribe technology.

If you compare to any other tribe, even the APPICS token, then they have a huge token supply, often the issued millions and have a billion or more max tokens. This is in my view not so serious, as scarcity of a token is very important for the users. Like Bitcoin has 21 million max coins ever, then LASSECASH has 51 million tokens ever. In effect LASSECASH is much more scares then even STEEM, that has around 300 million coins currently and ever expanding with inflation.

Scotbot parameters
--

You can see the active parameters at all times at http://scot.today/token/LASSECASH and then click “SCOTSetting”. I tried to tweak the parameters to be more successful then STEEM. The most important changes from the STEEM, is that LASSECASH has 14 days reward window (meaning you receive your author and curator rewards for a post, 14 days after the post is made) and that the powerdown time is 13 payments every 14 day over 6 months. This is made to incentivize longterm mentality. Furthermore the payout ration is 90% LASSECASH POWER and 10% LASSECASH, this is another huge difference from STEEM.

Lasse as leader of LASSECASH
--

I am naturally the leader of LASSECASH, and will be the one to resolve any dispute or drama, since I have the biggest stake. This is a fact that you can like or not and then decide to participate or not. There may be advantages over STEEM, where there are problems with toxic individuals.
