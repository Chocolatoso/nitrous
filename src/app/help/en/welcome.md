## Welcome to Natural Medicine!

LOTUS is a social coin for enthusiasts of natural health - from herbalism and essential oils, to food as medicine, meditation and spirituality, as well as the relationship of human beings to the natural world through wild-crafting, permaculture and other 'healthy' earth centred practices. Many healing modalities are supported from ayurveda to TCM, qi gong and yoga, as well as homesteading community members who might invest in organic principles or grow food and plants as medicine. Earn LOTUS by publishing or interacting with others on the platform. 

This page is full of information to help you learn about how to use our platform. 

Once you have signed up, we recommend the 'Learn Lotus' posts which are particularly helpful to learn about how to to trade and buy LOTUS, how to format posts, what it means to delegate, and many other useful posts besides!

### <span id="Backup_your_password">Signing Up For An Account</span>

Natural Medicine runs off the Steem Blockchain. That means you need a Steem account. Once you have signed in, you will then be able to use **the same keys** to sign in to *any* of the Steem front ends, such as Natural Medicine or [Steempeak](https://steempeak.com/@naturalmedicine). 

Unlike centralized web services, **it is not possible to recover lost passwords on the Steem blockchain**.The most important sign in advice we can give you is to back up your password in a secure password manager such as Last Pass, as well as an offline printed copy *just in case*!

Remember your account has potential value, so ensure you treat it as such!

You can sign up for an account [here](), which is totally free, but may take a few days to a week. We recommend you use Steem Ninja. It costs $2.50 USD, but is instant, secure and pre-loaded with a little bit SP or steempower, which you need to get started. Don't worry, this will all become clearer as you continue to read below!

**To buy an account with Steem Ninja, please use our referral link [here](https://widget.steem.ninja/widget.html?referrer=naturalmedicine&image=http://metametheus.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/natural-medicine-io.png&title=)!**

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Setup_your_Profile_Avatar_and_Cover_Image"> Setup your Profile, Avatar, and Cover Image</span>

You can update your profile through the Settings page. This includes your display name, location, about information, and website.

To set your avatar image, enter a link to where the image is located into the "Profile Picture URL" field or use the "Upload an image" feature.

To set your cover image, enter a link to where the image is located into the "Cover Image URL" field or use the "Upload an image" feature.

Once you have made all your changes, click the "Update" button to save your profile.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Sign_Up_for_Discord">Sign Up for Discord</span>

A lot of users mingle and chat when they are not posting or browsing Natural Medicine. It is a great place to meet people and ask questions. The more connections you make, the more likely your publications will be noticed. 

Your [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) account is a separate account from your Natural Medicine account (or Steem account - **remember, they're the same!**)

Some channels allow you to share links, but others don't. For instance, our post promotion allows you to share links so that others might see your post and maybe upvote and comment. 

Don't worry if Discord isn't your kind of social media. Just pop in to ask a question or say hello once in a while - we love to see you!

**Remember, Discord is a third party app and not connected to the Steem blockchain.**

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Create_your_introduceyourself_post">Create your "Introduceyourself" Post</span>

While not required, the tradition for new users is to create an "introduceyourself" post in order to let the community get to know you.

You can see some examples of what other people have done [here](https://steemit.com/trending/introduceyourself). 

If you have other social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) you can help the community verify that you are who you say you are by sharing the link to your Steem profile on them. If you are claiming to be someone famous, this is pretty much expected.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>


### <span id="Free_to_Participate">Free to Participate</span>

It is free to post, comment, or vote on all content on Naturalmedicine.io You might even get paid for it!

However, you do need *some* resource credits (RC). They enable you to make 'transactions' on the blockchain, such as uploading images, posting, and commenting. Your account will come pre-loaded with enough RC to make your first post. The more you earn, the more RC you will gain. 

You may also be gifted some delegation by generous Steemians or Natural Medicine who wish you to get a head start. This means that they will lend you some Steempower so that you can post and comment without using up your resource credits too quickly. 

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="UpVotes_and_DownVotes">UpVotes and Downvotes</span>

Upvotes are Natural Medicine's way of saying you like someone's post or comment.

To upvote, click on the *Upvote* icon at the bottom of the post/comment. This will reward the post with LOTUS. **If you also have Steem invested, it will upvote in Steem too. Notice that comments and upvotes on Natural Medicine will also appear on the other front ends.**

Keep an eye on your STEEM power and try not to let it drop below 80 percent. You can check your voting power on [Steemworld](https://steemworld.org/@naturalmedicine), simply replacing the @naturalmedicine of with your own user name. In fact, you'll see lots of data here! 

Downvotes (flags) are for saying you disapprove of someone's post or comment. 

To downvote, click on the small down arrow at the bottom of the post or comment. These downvotes come from a separate reward pool and you get about ten free downvotes a day. 

You should only downvote if you disagree with the post rewards. 

If you have been downvoted, don't panic. Read more about why you might have been downvoted [in this post]() and what you can do about it. Often, it's simply a nudge for you to ensure you are doing the right thing, rather than a personal attack. 

**Our official downvoting account is called [@downlotus](https://www.naturalmedicine.io/@downlotus). If you would like to read more about our standards for content, read [here](https://www.naturalmedicine.io/naturalmedicine/@naturalmedicine/standards-for-content-and-a-little-note-about-rewards-and-downvotes).**

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Comments">Comments</span>

When you are new, commenting on other people's posts can be a great way to get involved in the community and to connect with people!

To comment on a post, or reply to an existing comment, click on the "Reply" link at the bottom of the post/comment. 

We love comments here, because they often add valuable wisdom to people's posts. We learn through community, building on a knowledge bank of natural healing practices that can improve both our own lives and the lives of others. We also know it's pretty nice to *recieve* a comment ourselves, so it's good advice to give them to others as well! It can also help increase your followers and gain new friends!

If you are a member of the Natural Medicine Discord server, you are welcome to post links to your posts there for others to view and comment upon, as long as they adhere to our [Standards for Content](https://www.naturalmedicine.io/naturalmedicine/@naturalmedicine/standards-for-content-and-a-little-note-about-rewards-and-downvotes).

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Creating_Posts">Creating Posts</span>

To create a post, click on the "Post" link in the upper right corner.

Posts have three main parts: Title, Content, and Tags.

You will want to make your title attractive and relevant to your content. Try to choose something that is intriguing for prospective readers!

The first image that you use will become the thumbnail image. We recommend a thumbnail aspect ratio of 16:19. A good thumbnail also helps people want to click on your post and read it!

You can insert images by dragging & dropping, pasting from the clipboard, or by selecting them.

Tags will help people find your posts. Each post can have up to five tags, separated by spaces. However, if you use [Steempeak](https://steempeak.com/@naturalmedicine) you can use ten tags! *Remember, it doesn't matter which front end you use, but to deal in all things LOTUS, use NaturalMedicine.io!*

The tags should all be relevant to the content in the post. You can browse content by tags, as well as see a list of popular tags that other users have used in their posts [here](https://www.naturalmedicine.io/trending/).  The first tag becomes the post's category and cannot be changed later.

<a href="#Posting_Guidelines">^</a>
### <span id="Followers_and_Feeds">Posting Guidelines</span>

We expect a certain standard of posts and are particularly strict with plagiarism. Ensure you source any writing or research that is not your own. Try not to post single photos. There are other Steem Dapps for that (decentralised apps). 

To be super clear about expectations, we have compiled our [Standards for Content](https://www.naturalmedicine.io/naturalmedicine/@naturalmedicine/standards-for-content-and-a-little-note-about-rewards-and-downvotes). Ensure you read these carefully. 

Remember, if you have been downvoted by @downlotus or any other LOTUS stakeholder, it is not a personal attack on *you*, but a reminder to use the #naturalmedicine tag wisely. 

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Followers_and_Feeds">Followers and Feeds</span>

To follow an author, click on their username and click the "Follow" button.

Once you follow someone, all of their posts will show up in your "Feed" on the homepage when you login.

As other Natural Medicine fans (or Steemians, as people are known across the Steem blockchain) come across your posts and comments, you will start to gain followers.

You can see all of your followers and the people you are following on your profile page.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Resteem">Resteem</span>

If you want to share someone else's post with all of your followers, click on the <Icon name="reblog" /> *resteem* icon. Resteems cannot be undone. 

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Digital_Currencies">Digital Currencies</span>

STEEM, Steem Power and Steem Dollars are the three forms of digital currency used by the Steem Blockchain.

In your Natural Medicine wallet, you'll also notice LOTUS and Lotus Power. 

This is because that every time you post and curate on NaturalMedicine.io, you'll also be earning Steem rewards! If someone on another Steem front end upvotes you, you will earn the token they have staked (or invested. If you're not sure how to 'stake' the tokens you have earnt, read this [post](https://www.naturalmedicine.io/tokens/@naturalmedicine/how-to-stake-power-up-your-lotus-coin)).

You will be able to see your Steem rewards for each post if you log on to Steempeak, Steemit or Busy. *Remember, these all are different ways to experience the same social media and be rewarded in Steem*. 

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Curation">Curation</span>

Up to 50% of the reward for each post goes to the people who upvoted on it. These people are called Curators.

The more LOTUS Power you have in your account, the more your votes will be worth, and the more potential curation rewards you can earn! As you engage with the curation process, you'll learn tricks to earn more. 


<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Payments">Payments</span>

Payouts are made 7 days after the post/comment is created. You can claim your rewards in your wallet after 7 days.

The projected payments may fluctuate (up and down) until the final payment amount is reached.

Payments for posts are split between the author (at least 50%) and the curators (up to 50%).

The author reward is paid 50% in Lotus Power and 50% in LOTUS by default.

Authors also have the option to decline payout, or be paid in 100% LOTUS!

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>

### <span id="Cashing_out_or_Spending_SBD">Cashing out or Spending LOTUS</span>

Once you have LOTUS, you can redeem these (commonly called staking or powering up on STEEM) to gain additional Lotus Power. This gives you more chance to earn through curation rewards. 

In your LOTUS wallet on NaturalMedicine.io, you can claim other tokens too, in one single claim.

At this point, you might like to exchange LOTUS for STEEM in [Steem Engine](https://steem-engine.com/). Remember what we said about using the same keys for **everything** on the Steem blockchain? The same applies here. 

In Steem Engine, you can find out which tokens you hold, which you have invested or 'staked' (or 'powered up'). 

You can also claim your earnt tokens in [SteemEngine](https://steem-engine.com/), as well as sell them and buy other tokens, or buy STEEM.

You can then exchange your STEEM and SBD for bitcoin on a third-party exchange such as [BlockTrades](https://blocktrades.us/) or [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/), or power it up so that you earn more STEEM! 

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>

### <span id="Earning_on_Natural Medicine">Earning on Natural Medicine</span>

Everyone's earnings are different. Try not to focus on other's earnings, especially those with an established user base who have learnt their way around the platform. The more you make friends and attend to the quality of your publications, the more you will earn. 

The amount of LOTUS a user earns depends on their content, following, level of investment and many, many other factors. You will get to understand LOTUS (and Steem) economics the more you get involved. Try to have fun!

We are here to support you. Ensure you pop in to our Discord server and ask as many questions as you need to get started.  

### <span id="Participating in Challenges">Participating in Challenges</span>

Natural Medicine often hosts challenges which encourage users to publish content related to specific themes. Everyone is welcome to join, and the best posts may win Steem or LOTUS. 

This is a great way to connect to others and learn. Keep an eye on the @naturalmedicine account for notification of new challenges.
