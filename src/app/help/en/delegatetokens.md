In today’s video we’ll walkthrough the delegation process for Steem-Engine tokens that are on the Steem blockchain. Delegations are one of the core features of proof of brain tokens that are built on the Steem blockchain. They allow one user to delegate the power of their staked tokens to another user without letting the tokens leave their Steem wallet (private keys).
