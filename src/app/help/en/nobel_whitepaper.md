# The NOBEL-Token (Whitepaper)

The purpose of the NOBEL-token is to honour the people that Alfred Nobel would appreciate. People, that do good things to other people, should be rewarded with this coin.
The NOBEL is an effective charity distribution tool, where the donators either directly support their favorite beneficence helpers or leave it up to the community to care about, that the money goes to the right places. The beneficence helpers do “Proof of Charity” by writing blogs about their work. STEEM (the base of NOBEL) is a great blockchain platform with a big and good minded community, that creates value by connecting the right people.

## The Problem:

A lot of people in the world work on charity projects or help their neighbors or do other good things to people. They don’t get rewarded for this and therefore they cannot help effectively nor do they have money for themselves (and need to have another job).
On the other hand there are people willing to support needy people, but they don’t know how to hand over the money to them. With NGOs the donators don’t see really what happens with their money.
Also there is a loss due to transaction costs and middlemen.

This is the targetgroup for the NOBEL world:

* People, who need help.
* People, who want to do something that counts to someone.
* Donators, that don’t want to spent 20% of their money to administration.
* Donators, that want to gift directly to needy people.
* Donators, that want to leave the decision, who shell get the money, to a trustworthy selfcontrolling community.
* Donators, that want to see concrete results.
* Curators, that want to upvote good content to bring the donated money to the right places.
* Charity helpers, that want to get publicity and/or support.

## The Solution:

With the NOBEL coin everyone can help to support the supporters. Everyone who has a STEEM-account (you can register here) can buy NOBEL coins on Steem-Engine-com. That money stabilizes the price. The coin can then be gifted to people working on charity projects or can be staked and the upvote-power can be used to support the charity helpers
