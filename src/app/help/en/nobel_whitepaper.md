# The NOBEL Whitepapaer
written by Achim Mertens


The purpose of the NOBEL-token is to honour the people that Alfred Nobel would appreciate. People, that do good things to other people, should be rewarded with this coin. The NOBEL is an high effective charity distribution tool, where the donators either directly support their favorite beneficence helpers or leave it up to the community to care about, that the money goes to the right places. The beneficence helpers do “Proof of Charity” by writing blogs about their work. [STEEM](https://steemit.com/) (the base of NOBEL) is a great blockchain platform with a big and good minded community, that creates value by connecting the right people. No NGO or middleman is needed.

The Problem:
============

A lot of people in the world work on charity projects or help their neighbors or do other good things to people. They don’t get rewarded for this and therefore they cannot help effectively nor do they have money for themselves (and need to have another job). On the other hand there are people willing to support needy people, but they don't know how to hand over the money to them. With NGOs the donators don't see really what happens with their money. Also there is a loss due to transaction costs and middlemen. This is the targetgroup for the NOBEL world:

*   People, who need help.
*   People, who want to do something that counts to someone.
*   Donators, that don't want to spent 20% of their money to administration.
*   Donators, that want to gift directly to needy people.
*   Donators, that want to leave the decision, who shell get the money, to a trustworthy selfcontrolling community.
*   Donators, that want to see concrete results.
*   Curators, that want to upvote good content to bring the donated money to the right places.
*   Charity helpers, that want to get publicity and/or support.

The Solution:
=============

With the NOBEL coin everyone can help to support the supporters. Everyone who has a STEEM-account (you can register [here](https://steemit.com)) can buy NOBEL coins on [Steem-Engine-com](https://steem-engine.com). That money stabilizes the price. The coin can then be gifted to people working on charity projects or can be staked and the upvote-power can be used to support the charity helpers. <br>
![Nobel_40px](https://greensniper.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/nobel_40px.png)

Approach:
---------

*   *   NOBEL offers a blockchain based donating system, that eliminates the middlemen.
    *   NOBEL offers a good hearded community, that brings together charity givers and takers.
    *   NOBEL offers a sense in this chaotic world and the feeling to be important.
    *   The main goal with the NOBEL token is to appreciate humanity.
    *   The actors:
        *   A donator
            *   can buy NOBEL. This money backs the system.
            *   can use the NOBEL to donate them directly to charity helpers.
            *   can stake the NOBEL and with that she can curate good Proof of Charity.
        *   An Investor
            *   can buy NOBEL token and wait until it raises in value.
            *   knows, that his money is placed in a good humanitarian environment.
            *   owns parts of the NOBEL system. The coins are also shares.
        *   A charity helper
            *   gets support and thanks for his work.
            *   needs to write good posts about his work (Proof of Charity).
        *   A curator
            *   should get some NOBEL token and stake them. This gives her higher weighted voting power.
            *   With her upvotes she gives posts with hashtag #nobel a value, that is appreciated by the Scotbot.
        *   The Scotbot
            *   This bot has a lot of NOBEL token in his backpack (total amount of NOBEL in the system is one billion).
            *   The bot checks each post on the STEEM blockchain, that is tagged with #nobel.
            *   The bot gives the author and the curators a small amount of NOBEL, depending on the number and power of upvotes.
        *   The needy people
            *   They just receive attention and a bit hope.
            *   They should be willing to get out of their situation.
    *   The NOBEL token is an automated system, based on the STEEM blockchain, that warranties, that all these actors find together and that their interactions are fullfilled trustworthy.
    *   There have been 1,000,000,000 (10 ^ 9) NOBEL coins created initially on July 19. 2019 by Achim Mertens.
    *   The authors, curators and the token creator earn STEEM also with each post they write or curate. This is their salary. They can also sell the NOBEL token, but at least for the whales this should not be the first option to keep the price high and trust into that system.

 Benefits:
----------

*   Value for the participants:
    *   We have created a system that is self-amplifying. The more people join, the more stable gets the system. With the next steps the token creator wants to establish an own webpage with a look and feel like a discrete social media platform (one could name it a "charity facebook"). The owner of NOBEL tokens are the owner of this system. With their voting power they can influence the next steps.

*   Measurements:
    *   There are some tools to see what is going on:
        *   [https://steemit.com/created/nobel](https://steemit.com/created/nobel)
            *   This page is the basic entry to the system. There one can see all posts with the hashtag #nobel. It is based on the STEEM platform. To join you need a STEEM account.
        *   [https://steem-engine.com/?p=sign\_in](https://steem-engine.com/?p=sign_in)
            *   Here you can exchange STEEM into NOBEL and backwards. You can claim your NOBEL tokens there.
        *   [https://steem-engine.rocks/transactions?symbol=nobel](https://steem-engine.rocks/transactions?symbol=nobel)
            *   Here you can see who and how many people are transacting NOBEL. Also you can observe the Scotbot and check out, if it does what it should do.
        *   [http://scot-api.steem-engine.com/get\_account\_history?account=achimmertens&type=curation\_reward&token=NOBEL&limit=100](http://scot-api.steem-engine.com/get_account_history?account=achimmertens&type=curation_reward&token=NOBEL&limit=100) Or [http://scot-api.steem-engine.com/get\_account\_history?account=achimmertens&type=curation\_reward&token=NOBEL&limit=100&author=ireneblessing](http://scot-api.steem-engine.com/get_account_history?account=achimmertens&type=curation_reward&token=NOBEL&limit=100&author=ireneblessing)
            *   Here you can see what a curator (in this example @ireneblessing) has earned.
        *   [http://scot-api.steem-engine.com/get\_account\_history?account=achimmertens&type=author\_reward&token=NOBEL&limit=100](http://scot-api.steem-engine.com/get_account_history?account=achimmertens&type=author_reward&token=NOBEL&limit=100)
            *   Here you can see what an author has earned (in this example @achimmertens).

*   Monetizing:
    *   When you have a STEEM account, you can see the total of all STEEM and subcoins like NOBEL in your wallet. This amount is shown in your local currency, depending on the current market value. You can send STEEM to a crypto exchange and there you can receive the money in your local currency.
        *   Example of the wallet from @achimmertens: https://steempeak.com/@achimmertens/transfers

Competition:
------------

*   Proof of Charity via blockchain is a very new topic. As far as I know is the NOBEL token in this form unique. There are some similar systems like:
    *   [https://www.binance.com/de](https://www.binance.com/de) -> They have charity projects, based on blockchain.
    *   [https://community.coinsence.org/dashboard](https://community.coinsence.org/dashboard) -> They have small working groups with own currencies (partly via blockchain)
    *   [https://Fundition.io](https://Fundition.io) They also do charity projects on the STEEM platform. One can support them directly there by donating STEEM. The difference is, that there is no own token system behind it, that accelerates the circulation of donating and spending. Their focus is on funding projects, our focus is on spending attention and hope also to small charity occasions. One can also combine fundition and NOBEL just by using the hashtag #nobel in the fundition posts.

Six Winning Participants With NOBEL:
=====================================

1\. Needy People
----------------

They get help without delivering something. But they should try to get out of the needy situation.

2\. Charity Helpers
-------------------

Now they get rewarded for the job they do. They can (and should) sell (or stake) the NOBEL coins. The only thing they have to do additional is to write and post about their work to create Proof of Charity and therefore trust into the coin. This is important to increase the value. Please use the hashtags #nobel and #steem. People, that do charity, should note how much time and how much money they have spend. That gives us a guess how many NOBEL this person should get. Example (originally taken from [@yohanon](https://steempeak.com/@yohan2on)):

> Yohan has bought 12 pairs of shoes for needy children and payed 35 US-Dollars for it. This is worth (with 1 NOBEL=1 STEEM = 0,35 US Dollar/STEEM) = 100 NOBEL for the shoes + further 100 (or whatever he guesses) NOBEL for the effort. He shall write it in his blog (#nobel), what the costs are and then he shall sell 200 NOBEL from his account. After that the supporter can buy 200 Nobel with his FIAT Money to keep the prize stable.

3\. The Donators
-----------------
Donators have with nobel.charity a tool to gift in three ways: <br>
1. Directly with maximal efficience: <br>
This means, there is no man in the middle. There are only banking exchange fees (that every NGO has to handle with also). When a donator knows who to support, he can give the NOBEL or STEEM token directly to the recipient. <br>
2. Supporting The Community: <br>
By buying NOBEL and sending it to the distribution bot @anobel, a donator keeps the price high. He puts money into the system. The community distributes NOBEL by upvoting, so the "best" charity helpers get the most token, which they can exchange now for a good value on the market. <br>
3. Gaining influence power:<br>
By buying NOBEL and staking it, the donator gets an investor and curator<br>

*Flyer made with canvas by Achim Mertens*


4\. The Investors
-----------------

The investors can buy new NOBEL and therefore give "real" money to the charity helpers. They can stake the coin and hope in a price raise. With staked NOBEL they can also curate.

5\. The Curators
----------------
Curators are people that have staked NOBEL. They either got it by writing blogs with hashtag #nobel and getting upvotes from other NOBEL-staker or they have been gifted some NOBEL or they have bought it. The more NOBEL they have staked, the more NOBEL are send from the distribution bot to the author and curators. 5% of the distributed NOBEL go to the curators, 95% to the authors.
They can upvote blogs with the hashtag #nobel to support the helpers without losing own coins. They can upvote blogs to influence the direction for future steps with the NOBEL system. They own a part of the NOBEL system.


6\. The System Itself And The Market Members
--------------------------------------------

New members have an ability to invest their money into a system that helps people. So they can win value, if the price rises. And they know, that the money is good invested (even if the price falls). Everyone can write blogs about NOBEL (with #nobel) and when the quality is good they can get gifts (later: upvotes) and therefore earn these tokens also. ![NOBEL_Circles](https://greensniper.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nobel_circles.jpeg)

Some Rules To Handle The NOBEL Token:
=====================================

*   **Humanity is more important than greed!!!** It is more important to support needy people than to get rich with the token. Please live this to get trust to the coin.
*   Give the token (or stake it and upvote ) to people, that have done good things to other people.
*   When you have done good things,
    *   please write about it and use the #nobel tag. It is important that others get aware of it to find supporters, that buy the token.
    *   sell some of your tokens for a good price. This is necessary to create an economic circle and give the token a value.
*   When you misuse the #nobel tag for posts, that have nothing to do with charity or promoting NOBEL, you will get a nice comment, a warning or a downvote (that also effects your STEEM reputation).

You may think "I want to do good things without knowing others about it". Of course this is also ok, but then you cannot find supporters. Your work would get much more effect, when you have a strong team behind you. Therefore it is necessary to get awareness and to give a good proof that you do a good work by writing blogs about it on the STEEM-platform.

The Whales (Big Investors)
==========================

A smal group of people has got 100,000.00 token in the beginning. They have some additional duties in their own interest:

*   They shall not sell the initial coins for the next 5 years. Therefore all of them have staked their coins.
*   They should do some advertising and influencing to get value and money into the system.

How do they get value into NOBEL?
---------------------------------

It's all about: Find more buyers than sellers. The coin itself has no value at all. The price will drop drastically, when we sell without having buyers. We need to establich a working system, that has value and then the money will follow. [![](https://greensniper.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nobel-value.png)](https://greensniper.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nobel-value.png)       _(left: initial status of NOBEL, right: healthy status of another coin)_ Achim (the creator of this token) is going to buy,

*   When people do charity (see example above)
*   max. 80 US Dollar/Month (status 2019/07)

If we find more people, that follow the example of Achim, then the budget is higher. We need to sell our "idea", not the token. Each tokenbuyer has to be handled like a customer.

What should they upvote?
---------------

With the upvotes from the whales they further incentivise people that are bringing value into our NOBEL system. This can be advertising/influencing or writing about projects, where the NOBEL coin is involved. ![image.png](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/achimmertens/VXn8ovGd-image.png) _(Sketch by Achim Mertens)_ For details about the configuration of the scotbot see [here](https://steempeak.com/nobel/@achimmertens/the-scotbot-distributes-the-nobel-token-now).

# NOBEL_FAQ:

**Why should I buy NOBEL?**
*   Every time you buy NOBEL, money flows into the system. This money is mentioned for people that do good things. So by buying NOBEL you contribute to "save the world" ;-).
*   Eliminate the middlemen and some of the transaction fee.
*   Take over control. Or let a community decide who to support.
*   Get "Proof of Charity"

![Donate_most_efficiently](https://greensniper.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/donate_most_efficiently.jpg) ([Flyer](https://greensniper.wordpress.com/how-to-donate-most-efficiently/) by Achim Mertens) 

**What can I do with the NOBEL (use cases)?**
*   You can gift it to people, that do charity. (See also: "To whom can I gift the NOBEL?")
*   You can stake it, to spend it later, when it has (hopefully) more value.
*   You can sell it (for hopefully a better price).
*   You can gift NOBEL as a (birthday) present
*   You can use NOBEL instead of gaming coins (and gift the pot)
*   You can pay helpers (when they accept it)
*   ... (more ideas welcome)

**Who shall buy the NOBEL?** 
Everyone can do that. The target group is people, that want to do good things, but don't know how. With buying NOBEL you support charity workers. 

**How do I get NOBEL?** 
You need to have an account on the STEEM blockchain. i.e. you can register here: [https://steemit.com](https://steemit.com). Then you need some STEEM. This you can earn by posting and upvoting or you can exchange it on a bank like [Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com) or [coinmerce](https://coinmerce.io/). With this STEEM you can buy tokens like NOBEL here: [https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&t=NOBEL](https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&t=NOBEL) You can also join our contests or airdrops to earn NOBEL (and STEEM at the same time). 
[](https://greensniper.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/howtobuynobeltoken.jpg)

**How does the NOBEL increase in value?** 
Sometimes, when you put things together something magic happens: Emergence. For example wind + sand -> wind + sand + dunes. The dunes are the emergence of this system. So it is with tokens that are used by people. The NOBEL was mainly built to create a cash flow from financial supporters to charity supporters . This means, I prognose the following phases (with the precondition, that our marketing works):
1.  The price has to find its value (Launch phase July-October 2019)
2.  The price will rise
3.  The price will stabilize

**How big is the risk when I buy NOBEL?** 
In that moment you buy, the price increases, which is good for the charity workers. When you gift the coin, then there is a (normal) risk for you, that the recipient do something other with your money. But with the Proof of Charity concept this risk is minimalized. When you keep it, then there is the normal market risk with every coin. The charity helpers sell the coins as soon as they need money. This keeps the risk of market effects for them low. There is a risk, that people get NOBLE coins by misusing the #noble tag, getting upvoted by others and then selling the coin. This is not the best idea for these people, because they can also get downvotes, which decreases the value of their posts and their (STEEM-) reputation. Especially, when a whale downvotes. But nevertheless, there is a small risk, that people get this coin without deserving it. Let's see in the future how big this effect is. One can observe the NOBEL market here: https://steem-engine.rocks/transactions?symbol=NOBEL 

**Do daytraders steel FIAT money?**
It looks like, when you buy NOBEL. You can often see, that you pay for people or bots, that have bought cheap NOBEL and sell them now, when you buy them. This looks like if you support parasits. But on the other hand, they also buy NOBEL and give therefore money to the target group, the charity helpers. To sum it up, they neither win nor loose money here. But they help us to close the gap between ask and bid.

**Who is doing the marketing?** 
Everyone who is convinced of the NOBEL or thinks it should be given a try. There are some whales that are eager to see the price rising. 

**How shall we do marketing?**
*   Write about the NOBEL. Post it on every social media (facebook, instagram, twitter, reddit, ...)
*   Offer contests. I.e.:
    *    "Show me your Charity work and you will get xxx NOBEL"
*   We can use the #seven77 movement to make 7 pushups for STEEM and NOBEL
*   Offer xxx NOBEL each for the first 10 posts about NOBEL
*   Offer Airdrops. I.e.:
    *   Buy 100 Nobel and you get 100 NOBEL extra

**Who shell sell the NOBEL?** 
The NOBEL is a free coin on the market, so everyone can sell it. But the aim of this token is, that mainly the people sell it, that have done charity. You can sell (or change) NOBEL here: [https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&t=NOBEL](https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&t=NOBEL) 

**What makes the NOBEL unique?**
> The NOBEL is an high effective charity distribution tool, where the donators either directly support their favorite charity workers or leave it up to the community to care about, that the money goes to the right places. The charity workers do “Proof of Charity” by writing blogs about their work. STEEM (the base of NOBEL) is a great blockchain platform with a big and good minded community, that creates value by connecting the right people. No NGO or middleman is needed.

The aim of the token is not mainly to get rich of it or to create financial value (when the price rises and you have staked NOBEL, you can also profit from it monetary), it is more a cashflow: With buying NOBEL, money comes in, with spending money by the charity helpers, money goes out. 

**To whom can I gift the NOBEL?** 
The target group is people that help other people. This can be your neighbor who helps you (or others) in the garden, but also charity helpers somewhere in the world. You can find them with the hashtag #nobel on the [steem plattform](https://steempeak.com/created/nobel). But you can also send it to charity groups like [@fundition](https://steempeak.com/@fundition), [@teamuganda, ](https://steempeak.com/@teamuganda).... They will use the money like an NGO to support the supporters. Honor people that do good things like in the next question: 

**What kind of charity can I do to get NOBEL?** 
Everything is allowed that helps other people and do not harm someone else. The more work and effort you invest and the more it helps, the more token you should get. So supporting children to get good education is more value than playing football with them. Here are some examples:
*   Helping needy children
*   Giving food or clothes to poor people
*   paying school fees
*   Going to demonstrations for liberty or humanity (i.e. #firdaysforfuture)
*   Help in the neighborhood

**Who are the charity helpers?** 
In the beginning it is [@Yohan2on](https://steempeak.com/@yohan2on) (I met him personally in Uganda) [@manchochris](https://steempeak.com/@manchochris) and [@muzito08](https://steemit.com/@muzito08).  But I hope a lot of people will follow. It can be everyone. 

**How can I get a charity helper?**
*   Get an account on https://steemit.com
*   Do something good to other (needy) people
*   Write a blog about it on https://steemit.com (or another frontend for STEEM)
*   Show in detail what you did with pictures to create a "Proof of Charity".
*   Include how much effort and costs you have had for your charity work.
*   Use the hashtag #nobel (see the example above under "Charity Helpers").
Then you should hopefully get some of the coins.
