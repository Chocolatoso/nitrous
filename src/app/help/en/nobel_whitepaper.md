# The NOBEL-Token (Whitepaper)

The purpose of the NOBEL-token is to honour the people that Alfred Nobel would appreciate. People, that do good things to other people, should be rewarded with this coin.
The NOBEL is an effective charity distribution tool, where the donators either directly support their favorite beneficence helpers or leave it up to the community to care about, that the money goes to the right places. The beneficence helpers do “Proof of Charity” by writing blogs about their work. STEEM (the base of NOBEL) is a great blockchain platform with a big and good minded community, that creates value by connecting the right people.

## The Problem:

A lot of people in the world work on charity projects or help their neighbors or do other good things to people. They don’t get rewarded for this and therefore they cannot help effectively nor do they have money for themselves (and need to have another job).
On the other hand there are people willing to support needy people, but they don’t know how to hand over the money to them. With NGOs the donators don’t see really what happens with their money.
Also there is a loss due to transaction costs and middlemen.

This is the targetgroup for the NOBEL world:

* People, who need help.
* People, who want to do something that counts to someone.
* Donators, that don’t want to spent 20% of their money to administration.
* Donators, that want to gift directly to needy people.
* Donators, that want to leave the decision, who shell get the money, to a trustworthy selfcontrolling community.
* Donators, that want to see concrete results.
* Curators, that want to upvote good content to bring the donated money to the right places.
* Charity helpers, that want to get publicity and/or support.

## The Solution:

With the NOBEL coin everyone can help to support the supporters. Everyone who has a STEEM-account (you can register here) can buy NOBEL coins on Steem-Engine-com. That money stabilizes the price. The coin can then be gifted to people working on charity projects or can be staked and the upvote-power can be used to support the charity helpers
## Approach:
- NOBEL offers a blockchain based donating system, that eliminates the middlemen.
- NOBEL offers a good hearded community, that brings together charity givers and takers.
- NOBEL offers a sense in this chaotic world and the feeling to be important.
- The main goal with the NOBEL token is to appreciate humanity.
### The actors:
- A donator
   - can buy NOBEL. This money backs the system.
   - can use the NOBEL to donate them directly to charity helpers.
   - can stake the NOBEL and with that she can curate good Proof of Charity.
- An Investor
   - can buy NOBEL token and wait until it raises in value.
   - knows, that his money is placed in a good humanitarian environment.
   - owns parts of the NOBEL system. The coins are also shares.
- A charity helper
   - gets support and thanks for his work.
   - needs to write good posts about his work (Proof of Charity).
- A curator
   - should get some NOBEL token and stake them. This gives her higher weighted voting power.
   - With her upvotes she gives posts with hashtag #nobel a value, that is appreciated by the Scotbot.
- The Scotbot
   - This bot has a lot of NOBEL token in his backpack (total amount of NOBEL in the system is one billion).
   - The bot checks each post on the STEEM blockchain, that is tagged with #nobel.
   - The bot gives the author and the curators a small amount of NOBEL, depending on the number and power of upvotes.
- The needy people
   - They just receive attention and a bit hope.
   - They should be willing to get out of their situation.
- The NOBEL token is an automated system, based on the STEEM blockchain, that warranties, that all these actors find together and that their interactions are fullfilled trustworthy.
- The NOBEL token was created by Achim Mertens from Germany (@achimmertens).
- The authors, curators and the token creator earn STEEM also with each post they write or curate. This is their salary. They can also sell the NOBEL token, but at least for the whales this should not be the first option to keep the price high and trust into that system.
 
## Benefits:
- Value for the participants:
   - We have created a system that is self-amplifying. The more people join, the more stable gets the system. With the next steps the token creator wants to establish an own webpage with a look and feel like a discrete social media platform (one could name it a "charity facebook"). The owner of NOBEL tokens are the owner of this system. With their voting power they can influence the next steps.

### Measurements:
- There are some tools to see what is going on:
   - https://steemit.com/created/nobel
      - This page is the basic entry to the system. There one can see all posts with the hashtag #nobel. It is based on the STEEM platform. To join you need a STEEM account.
   - https://steem-engine.com/?p=sign_in
      - Here you can exchange STEEM into NOBEL and backwards. You can claim your NOBEL tokens there.
   - https://steem-engine.rocks/transactions?symbol=nobel
      - Here you can see who and how many people are transacting NOBEL. Also you can observe the Scotbot and check out, if it does what it should do.
   - http://scot-api.steem-engine.com/get_account_history?account=achimmertens&type=curation_reward&token=NOBEL&limit=100
Or http://scot-api.steem-engine.com/get_account_history?account=achimmertens&type=curation_reward&token=NOBEL&limit=100&author=ireneblessing
      - Here you can see what a curator (in this example @ireneblessing) has earned.
   - http://scot-api.steem-engine.com/get_account_history?account=achimmertens&type=author_reward&token=NOBEL&limit=100
      - Here you can see what an author has earned (in this example @achimmertens).

### Monetizing:
When you have a STEEM account, you can see the total of all STEEM and subcoins like NOBEL in your wallet. This amount is shown in your local currency, depending on the current market value. You can send STEEM to a crypto exchange and there you can receive the money in your local currency.
Example of the wallet from @achimmertens: https://steempeak.com/@achimmertens/transfers

## Competition:
Proof of Charity via blockchain is a very new topic. As far as I know is the NOBEL token in this form unique. There are some similar systems like:
- https://www.binance.com/de -> They have charity projects, based on blockchain.
- https://community.coinsence.org/dashboard -> They have small working groups with own currencies (partly via blockchain)
- https://Fundition.io They also do charity projects on the STEEM platform. One can support them directly there by donating STEEM. The difference is, that there is no own token system behind it, that accelerates the circulation of donating and spending. Their focus is on funding projects, our focus is on spending attention and hope also to small charity occasions. One can also combine fundition and NOBEL just by using the hashtag #nobel in the fundition posts.


## Four Winning Participants With NOBEL:



### 1\. Needy People

They get help without delivering something. But they should try to get out of the needy situation.

### 2\. Charity Helpers

Now they get rewarded for the job they do. They can (and should) sell (or stake) the NOBEL coins. The only thing they have to do additional is to write and post about their work to create Proof of Charity and therefore trust into the coin. This is important to increase the value. Please use the hashtags #nobel and #steem. People, that do charity, should note how much time and how much money they have spend. That gives us a guess how many NOBEL this person should get. Example (originally taken from [@yohanon](https://steempeak.com/@yohan2on)):

> Yohan has bought 12 pairs of shoes for needy children and payed 35 US-Dollars for it. This is worth (with 1 NOBEL=1 STEEM = 0,35 US Dollar/STEEM) = 100 NOBEL for the shoes + further 100 (or whatever he guesses) NOBEL for the effort. He shall write it in his blog (#nobel), what the costs are and then he shall sell 200 NOBEL from his account. After that the supporter can buy 200 Nobel with his FIAT Money to keep the prize stable.

### 3\. The Investors


The investors can buy new NOBEL and therefore give "real" money to the charity helpers. They can gift some NOBEL directly to the workers. They can stake the coin and hope in a price raise. They can upvote blogs with the hashtag [#nobel](https://steempeak.com/created/nobel) to support the helpers without losing own coins. They can upvote blogs to influence the direction for future steps with the NOBEL system.

### 4\. The System Itself And The Market Members

New members have an ability to invest their money into a system that helps people. So they can win value, if the price rises. And they know, that the money is good invested (even if the price falls). Everyone can write blogs about NOBEL (with #nobel) and when the quality is good they can get gifts (later: upvotes) and therefore earn these tokens also. ![NOBEL_Circles](https://greensniper.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nobel_circles.jpeg)
