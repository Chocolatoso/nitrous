<h2> Description:</h2>

One of the most long-awaited features of the Steem blockchain has been Communities. Communities exist both in a back-end and front-end environment. 

On the back-end, communities have been developed under the “Hivemind” protocol. On the front-end, they can be seen in a myriad of places and displayed in all sorts of fascinating ways — Steemleo.com shows only our community (for crypto & financial content), Steempeak.com shows all the communities (similar to Steemit, but in their own visual representation) and now Steemit.com shows the fundamental base of communities and all the various ones on the blockchain.
