[Steem Keychain](https://steemleo.com/keychain) is a browser extension for the Steem blockchain. It allows you to manage your Steem account(s) seamlessly from your browser. The extension itself has a plethora of features, but the real magic happens when you use the Keychain extension to log-in to Steem web applications (dApps).

With the keychain extension, you can keep a low-level private key (i.e. your Steem account posting key/active key) encrypted in the extension. Once you've done that, you can login to Steem Apps by simply entering your username and then clicking login. The login sequence will then prompt the Keychain popup window to confirm that you own the account.

The beauty of this is that you don't have to enter your private keys into websites. You store an encrypted version of the keys locally through the Keychain extension and then you grant access to your account as you use various applications. It makes for a much **faster** and much more **secure** user experience for your Steem activities.

There is a Leopedia guide available showing exactly how to download and setup the Keychain browser extension, check it out at https://steemleo.com/keychain.
